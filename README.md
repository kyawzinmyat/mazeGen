# mazeGen

--title Maze generator and solver
--https://youtu.be/Dz6NYz66Sac

-Generate 2 dimensional maze using randomised depth first search.

-Start and end of the maze will be generated randomly 

-Red indicate start and green indicate end

-The progrma uses pygame to visualize the maze and path finding algorithms (dfs and bfs)

-mazegen.py will generate the 2d maze with start and end 

-game.py store the result of mazegen.py in the maze.csv file

-each cell is simulated with 3x3 matrix

-currently row and column cannot be set directly from pygame gui but can still change in the game.py

-findpat.py provides two path finding algorithms including BFS and DFS

-run game.py to start

-generate new maze will create new maze

-show path (dfs) will visualise the instant path with animation

-show path (bfs) same as dfs one

-show path 2 will visualise how DFS and BFS find a path with animation
